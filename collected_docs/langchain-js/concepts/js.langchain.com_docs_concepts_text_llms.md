These models are typically named without the "Chat" prefix (e.g., Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.), and may include the "LLM" suffix (e.g., OpenAILLM, etc.). These models implement the [BaseLLM](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_llms.BaseLLM.html) interface.Users should be using almost exclusively the newer [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models) as most model providers have adopted a chat like interface for interacting with language models. #### Was this page helpful? #### You can also leave detailed feedback [on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=03+-+Documentation&projects=&template=documentation.yml&title=DOC%3A+%3CPlease+write+a+comprehensive+title+after+the+%27DOC%3A+%27+prefix%3E).
