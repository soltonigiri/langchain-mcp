Traces contain individual steps called runs. These can be individual calls from a model, retriever, tool, or sub-chains. Tracing gives you observability inside your chains and agents, and is vital in diagnosing issues.For a deeper dive, check out this LangSmith conceptual guide](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/tracing). #### Was this page helpful? #### You can also leave detailed feedback [on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=03+-+Documentation&projects=&template=documentation.yml&title=DOC%3A+%3CPlease+write+a+comprehensive+title+after+the+%27DOC%3A+%27+prefix%3E).
