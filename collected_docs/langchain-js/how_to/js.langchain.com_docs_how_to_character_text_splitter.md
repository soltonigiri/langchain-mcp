This is the simplest method for splitting text. This splits based on a given character sequence, which defaults to `"\n\n"`. Chunk length is measured by number of characters.

- How the text is split: by single character separator.
- How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.

To obtain the string content directly, use `.splitText()`.

To create LangChain [Document](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.documents.Document.html) objects (e.g., for use in downstream tasks), use `.createDocuments()`.

```typescript
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

// Load an example document
const rawData = await fs.readFileSync(
  "../../../../examples/state_of_the_union.txt"
);
const stateOfTheUnion = rawData.toString();

const textSplitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
  separator: "\n\n",
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const texts = await textSplitter.createDocuments([stateOfTheUnion]);
console.log(texts[0]);

```

```text
Document {
  pageContent: "Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and th"... 839 more characters,
  metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 1, to: 17 } } }
}

```You can also propagate metadata associated with each document to the output chunks:

```typescript
const metadatas = [{ document: 1 }, { document: 2 }];

const documents = await textSplitter.createDocuments(
  [stateOfTheUnion, stateOfTheUnion],
  metadatas
);

console.log(documents[0]);

```

```text
Document {
  pageContent: "Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and th"... 839 more characters,
  metadata: { document: 1, loc: { lines: { from: 1, to: 17 } } }
}

```To obtain the string content directly, use `.splitText()`:

```typescript
const chunks = await textSplitter.splitText(stateOfTheUnion);

chunks[0];

```

```text
"Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and th"... 839 more characters
