- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)

Language models output text. But there are times where you want to get more structured information than just text back. While some model providers support [built-in ways to return structured output](/docs/how_to/structured_output), not all do. For these providers, you must use prompting to encourage the model to return structured data in the desired format.

LangChain has [output parsers](/docs/concepts/output_parsers) which can help parse model outputs into usable objects. We‚Äôll go over a few examples below.

## Get started[‚Äã](#get-started)

The primary type of output parser for working with structured data in model responses is the [StructuredOutputParser](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.output_parsers.StructuredOutputParser.html). In the below example, we define a schema for the type of output we expect from the model using [zod](https://zod.dev).

First, let‚Äôs see the default formatting instructions we‚Äôll plug into the prompt:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { StructuredOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const zodSchema = z.object({
  answer: z.string().describe("answer to the user&#x27;s question"),
  source: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "source used to answer the user&#x27;s question, should be a website."
    ),
});

const parser = StructuredOutputParser.fromZodSchema(zodSchema);

const chain = RunnableSequence.from([
  ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
    "Answer the users question as best as possible.\n{format_instructions}\n{question}"
  ),
  model,
  parser,
]);

console.log(parser.getFormatInstructions());

```

```text
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json
{"type":"object","properties":{"answer":{"type":"string","description":"answer to the user&#x27;s question"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"source used to answer the user&#x27;s question, should be a website."}},"required":["answer","source"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}
```

```Next, let‚Äôs invoke the chain:

```typescript
const response = await chain.invoke({
  question: "What is the capital of France?",
  format_instructions: parser.getFormatInstructions(),
});

console.log(response);

```

```text
{
  answer: "The capital of France is Paris.",
  source: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"
}

```Output parsers implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel), the basic building block of [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel). This means they support `invoke`, `stream`, `batch`, `streamLog` calls.

## Validation[‚Äã](#validation)

One feature of the `StructuredOutputParser` is that it supports stricter Zod validations. For example, if you pass a simulated model output that does not conform to the schema, we get a detailed type error:

```typescript
import { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await parser.invoke(new AIMessage(`{"badfield": "foo"}`));

```

```text
Error: Failed to parse. Text: "{"badfield": "foo"}". Error: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "string",
    "received": "undefined",
    "path": [
      "answer"
    ],
    "message": "Required"
  },
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "string",
    "received": "undefined",
    "path": [
      "source"
    ],
    "message": "Required"
  }
]

```Compared to:

```typescript
await parser.invoke(
  new AIMessage(`{"answer": "Paris", "source": "I made it up"}`)
);

```

```text
{ answer: "Paris", source: "I made it up" }

```More advanced Zod validations are supported as well. To learn more, check out the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev).

## Streaming[‚Äã](#streaming)

While all parsers are runnables and support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. The `StructuredOutputParser` does not support partial streaming because it validates the output at each step. If you try to stream using a chain with this output parser, the chain will simply yield the fully parsed output:

```typescript
const stream = await chain.stream({
  question: "What is the capital of France?",
  format_instructions: parser.getFormatInstructions(),
});

for await (const s of stream) {
  console.log(s);
}

```

```text
{
  answer: "The capital of France is Paris.",
  source: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"
}

```The simpler [JsonOutputParser](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.output_parsers.JsonOutputParser.html), however, supports streaming through partial outputs:

```typescript
import { JsonOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";

const template = `Return a JSON object with a single key named "answer" that answers the following question: {question}.
Do not wrap the JSON output in markdown blocks.`;

const jsonPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template);
const jsonParser = new JsonOutputParser();
const jsonChain = jsonPrompt.pipe(model).pipe(jsonParser);

const stream = await jsonChain.stream({
  question: "Who invented the microscope?",
});

for await (const s of stream) {
  console.log(s);
}

```

Next, check out the [guide on tool calling](/docs/how_to/tool_calling), a more built-in way of obtaining structured output that some model providers support, or read more about output parsers for other types of structured data like [XML](/docs/how_to/output_parser_xml).
