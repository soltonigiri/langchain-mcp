- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Calling runnables in parallel](/docs/how_to/parallel/)
- [Custom functions](/docs/how_to/functions/)

When composing chains with several steps, sometimes you will want to pass data from previous steps unchanged for use as input to a later step. The [RunnablePassthrough](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.RunnablePassthrough.html) class allows you to do just this, and is typically is used in conjuction with a [RunnableParallel](/docs/how_to/parallel/) to pass data through to a later step in your constructed chains.

Let‚Äôs look at an example:

```typescript
import {
  RunnableParallel,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const runnable = RunnableParallel.from({
  passed: new RunnablePassthrough<{ num: number }>(),
  modified: (input: { num: number }) => input.num + 1,
});

await runnable.invoke({ num: 1 });

```

```text
{ passed: { num: 1 }, modified: 2 }

```As seen above, `passed` key was called with `RunnablePassthrough()` and so it simply passed on `{&#x27;num&#x27;: 1}`.

We also set a second key in the map with `modified`. This uses a lambda to set a single value adding 1 to the num, which resulted in `modified` key with the value of `2`.

## Retrieval Example[‚Äã](#retrieval-example)

In the example below, we see a more real-world use case where we use `RunnablePassthrough` along with `RunnableParallel` in a chain to properly format inputs to a prompt:

tipSee [this section for general instructions on installing integration packages](/docs/how_to/installation#installing-integration-packages).

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm

```bash
npm i @langchain/openai @langchain/core

```

```bash
yarn add @langchain/openai @langchain/core

```

```bash
pnpm add @langchain/openai @langchain/core

```

```typescript
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import {
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableSequence,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";

const vectorstore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  [{ pageContent: "harrison worked at kensho", metadata: {} }],
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

const retriever = vectorstore.asRetriever();

const template = `Answer the question based only on the following context:
{context}

Question: {question}
`;

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(template);

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });

const retrievalChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    context: retriever.pipe((docs) => docs[0].pageContent),
    question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  },
  prompt,
  model,
  new StringOutputParser(),
]);

await retrievalChain.invoke("where did harrison work?");

```

```text
"Harrison worked at Kensho."

```Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys `"context"` and `"question"`. The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the `"question"` key. The `RunnablePassthrough` allows us to pass on the user‚Äôs question to the prompt and model.

Now you‚Äôve learned how to pass data through your chains to help to help format the data flowing through your chains.
