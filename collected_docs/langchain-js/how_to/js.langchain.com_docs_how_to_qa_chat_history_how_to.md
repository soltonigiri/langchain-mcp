How to add chat history | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó Langchain
- **[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)Our new LangChain Academy Course Deep Research with LangGraph is now live! [Enroll for free](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/deep-research-with-langgraph/?utm_medium=internal&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=q3-2025_deep-research-course_co).[On this pageHow to add chat historyThis tutorial previously built a chatbot using RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html). You can access this version of the tutorial in the [v0.2 docs](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to/).The LangGraph implementation offers a number of advantages over RunnableWithMessageHistory, including the ability to persist arbitrary components of an application‚Äôs state (instead of only messages).In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.In this guide we focus on adding logic for incorporating historical messages.**This is largely a condensed version of the [Conversational RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history).We will cover two approaches:[Chains](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#chains), in which we always execute a retrieval step;
- [Agents](/docs/how_to/qa_chat_history_how_to#agents), in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).

For the external knowledge source, we will use the same [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng from the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).

## Setup[‚Äã](#setup)

### Dependencies[‚Äã](#dependencies)

We‚Äôll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Memory vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/concepts/chat_models) or [LLM](/docs/concepts/text_llms), [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models), and [VectorStore](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) or [Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers).

We‚Äôll use the following packages:

```bash
npm install --save langchain @langchain/openai langchain cheerio uuid

```

We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

```

### LangSmith[‚Äã](#langsmith) Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true

```

## Chains[‚Äã](#chains) In a conversational RAG application, queries issued to the retriever should be informed by the context of the conversation. LangChain provides a [createHistoryAwareRetriever](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chains_history_aware_retriever.createHistoryAwareRetriever.html) constructor to simplify this. It constructs a chain that accepts keys `input` and `chat_history` as input, and has the same output schema as a retriever. `createHistoryAwareRetriever` requires as inputs:

- LLM;
- Retriever;
- Prompt.

First we obtain these objects:

``` ### Initial setup[‚Äã](#initial-setup)

```typescript
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const loader = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
);

const docs = await loader.load();

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const splits = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(docs);
const vectorStore = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splits,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();

``` ### Prompt[‚Äã](#prompt) We‚Äôll use a prompt that includes a `MessagesPlaceholder` variable under the name ‚Äúchat_history‚Äù. This allows us to pass in a list of Messages to the prompt using the ‚Äúchat_history‚Äù input key, and these messages will be inserted after the system message and before the human message containing the latest question.

```typescript
import {
  ChatPromptTemplate,
  MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const contextualizeQSystemPrompt =
  "Given a chat history and the latest user question " +
  "which might reference context in the chat history, " +
  "formulate a standalone question which can be understood " +
  "without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, " +
  "just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.";

const contextualizeQPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", contextualizeQSystemPrompt],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
  ["human", "{input}"],
]);

```

### Assembling the chain[‚Äã](#assembling-the-chain) We can then instantiate the history-aware retriever:

```typescript
import { createHistoryAwareRetriever } from "langchain/chains/history_aware_retriever";

const historyAwareRetriever = await createHistoryAwareRetriever({
  llm,
  retriever,
  rephrasePrompt: contextualizeQPrompt,
});

```

This chain prepends a rephrasing of the input query to our retriever, so that the retrieval incorporates the context of the conversation.

Now we can build our full QA chain.

As in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag), we will use [createStuffDocumentsChain](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chains_combine_documents.createStuffDocumentsChain.html) to generate a `questionAnswerChain`, with input keys `context`, `chat_history`, and `input`‚Äì it accepts the retrieved context alongside the conversation history and query to generate an answer.

We build our final `ragChain` with [createRetrievalChain](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chains_retrieval.createRetrievalChain.html). This chain applies the `historyAwareRetriever` and `questionAnswerChain` in sequence, retaining intermediate outputs such as the retrieved context for convenience. It has input keys `input` and `chat_history`, and includes `input`, `chat_history`, `context`, and `answer` in its output.

```typescript
import { createStuffDocumentsChain } from "langchain/chains/combine_documents";
import { createRetrievalChain } from "langchain/chains/retrieval";

const systemPrompt =
  "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. " +
  "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer " +
  "the question. If you don&#x27;t know the answer, say that you " +
  "don&#x27;t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the " +
  "answer concise." +
  "\n\n" +
  "{context}";

const qaPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", systemPrompt],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
  ["human", "{input}"],
]);

const questionAnswerChain = await createStuffDocumentsChain({
  llm,
  prompt: qaPrompt,
});

const ragChain = await createRetrievalChain({
  retriever: historyAwareRetriever,
  combineDocsChain: questionAnswerChain,
});

```

### Stateful Management of chat history[‚Äã](#stateful-management-of-chat-history) We have added application logic for incorporating chat history, but we are still manually plumbing it through our application. In production, the Q&A application we usually persist the chat history into a database, and be able to read and update it appropriately.

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) implements a built-in [persistence layer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/persistence/), making it ideal for chat applications that support multiple conversational turns.

Wrapping our chat model in a minimal LangGraph application allows us to automatically persist the message history, simplifying the development of multi-turn applications.

LangGraph comes with a simple [in-memory checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/checkpoint.MemorySaver.html), which we use below. See its documentation for more detail, including how to use different persistence backends (e.g., SQLite or Postgres).

For a detailed walkthrough of how to manage message history, head to the How to add message history (memory) guide.

```typescript
import { AIMessage, BaseMessage, HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import {
  StateGraph,
  START,
  END,
  MemorySaver,
  messagesStateReducer,
  Annotation,
} from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Define the State interface
const GraphAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  input: Annotation<string>(),
  chat_history: Annotation<BaseMessage[]>({
    reducer: messagesStateReducer,
    default: () => [],
  }),
  context: Annotation<string>(),
  answer: Annotation<string>(),
});

// Define the call_model function
async function callModel(state: typeof GraphAnnotation.State) {
  const response = await ragChain.invoke(state);
  return {
    chat_history: [
      new HumanMessage(state.input),
      new AIMessage(response.answer),
    ],
    context: response.context,
    answer: response.answer,
  };
}

// Create the workflow
const workflow = new StateGraph(GraphAnnotation)
  .addNode("model", callModel)
  .addEdge(START, "model")
  .addEdge("model", END);

// Compile the graph with a checkpointer object
const memory = new MemorySaver();
const app = workflow.compile({ checkpointer: memory });

```

```typescript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

const threadId = uuidv4();
const config = { configurable: { thread_id: threadId } };

const result = await app.invoke(
  { input: "What is Task Decomposition?" },
  config
);
console.log(result.answer);

```

```text
Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complicated task into smaller, simpler, and more manageable steps. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts expand on this by enabling agents to think step by step or explore multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. This allows for a more structured and interpretable approach to handling complex tasks.

```

```typescript
const result2 = await app.invoke(
  { input: "What is one way of doing it?" },
  config
);
console.log(result2.answer);

```

```text
One way of doing task decomposition is by using an LLM with simple prompting, such as asking "Steps for XYZ.\n1." or "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?" This method leverages direct prompts to guide the model in breaking down tasks.

```The conversation history can be inspected via the state of the application:

```typescript
const chatHistory = (await app.getState(config)).values.chat_history;
for (const message of chatHistory) {
  console.log(message);
}

```

```text
HumanMessage {
  "content": "What is Task Decomposition?",
  "additional_kwargs": {},
  "response_metadata": {}
}
AIMessage {
  "content": "Task Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complicated task into smaller, simpler, and more manageable steps. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts expand on this by enabling agents to think step by step or explore multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

For convenience, we tie together all of the necessary steps in a single code cell:

```typescript

const llm2 = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });

const loader2 = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(

```text
Task Decomposition is the process of breaking a complicated task into smaller, simpler steps to enhance model performance on complex tasks. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) are used for this, with CoT focusing on step-by-step thinking and ToT exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Decomposition can be carried out by the LLM itself, using task-specific instructions, or through human inputs.
One way of doing task decomposition is by prompting the LLM with simple instructions such as "Steps for XYZ.\n1." or "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?" This encourages the model to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps on its own.

``` ## Agents[‚Äã](#agents) Agents leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to make decisions during execution. Using agents allow you to offload some discretion over the retrieval process. Although their behavior is less predictable than chains, they offer some advantages in this context: - Agents generate the input to the retriever directly, without necessarily needing us to explicitly build in contextualization, as we did above; - Agents can execute multiple retrieval steps in service of a query, or refrain from executing a retrieval step altogether (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from a user).

### Retrieval tool[‚Äã](#retrieval-tool)

Agents can access ‚Äútools‚Äù and manage their execution. In this case, we will convert our retriever into a LangChain tool to be wielded by the agent:

```typescript
import { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/tools/retriever";

const tool = createRetrieverTool(retriever, {
  name: "blog_post_retriever",
  description:
    "Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
});
const tools = [tool];

```

### Agent constructor[‚Äã](#agent-constructor) Now that we have defined the tools and the LLM, we can create the agent. We will be using [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs) to construct the agent. Currently we are using a high level interface to construct the agent, but the nice thing about LangGraph is that this high-level interface is backed by a low-level, highly controllable API in case you want to modify the agent logic.

```typescript
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

const agentExecutor = createReactAgent({ llm, tools });

```

We can now try it out. Note that so far it is not stateful (we still need to add in memory)

```typescript
const query = "What is Task Decomposition?";

for await (const s of await agentExecutor.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }],
})) {
  console.log(s);
  console.log("----");
}

```

```text
{
  agent: {
    messages: [
      AIMessage {
        "id": "chatcmpl-AB7xlcJBGSKSp1GvgDY9FP8KvXxwB",

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to ‚Äúthink step by step‚Äù to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model‚Äôs thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.

```LangGraph comes with built in persistence, so we don‚Äôt need to use `ChatMessageHistory`! Rather, we can pass in a checkpointer to our LangGraph agent directly.

Distinct conversations are managed by specifying a key for a conversation thread in the config object, as shown below.

```typescript
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const memory3 = new MemorySaver();

const agentExecutor2 = createReactAgent({
  llm,
  tools,
  checkpointSaver: memory3,
});

```

This is all we need to construct a conversational RAG agent.

Let‚Äôs observe its behavior. Note that if we input a query that does not require a retrieval step, the agent does not execute one:

```typescript
const threadId3 = uuidv4();
const config3 = { configurable: { thread_id: threadId3 } };

for await (const s of await agentExecutor2.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hi! I&#x27;m bob" }] },
  config3
)) {
  console.log(s);
  console.log("----");
}

```

```text

      AIMessage {
        "id": "chatcmpl-AB7y8P8AGHkxOwKpwMc3qj6r0skYr",

          },

          "total_tokens": 76
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

```Further, if we input a query that does require a retrieval step, the agent generates the input to the tool:

```typescript
const query2 = "What is Task Decomposition?";

for await (const s of await agentExecutor2.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: query2 }] },
  config3
)) {
  console.log(s);
  console.log("----");

```Above, instead of inserting our query verbatim into the tool, the agent stripped unnecessary words like ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúis‚Äù.

This same principle allows the agent to use the context of the conversation when necessary:

Examples include:\n   - \"Steps for XYZ. 1.\"\n   - \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\"\n   - Task-specific instructions like \"Write a story outline\" for writing a novel.\n\n2. **Human Inputs**: Decomposition can be guided by human insights and instructions.\n\n3. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This technique prompts a model to think step-by-step, enabling it to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks. CoT has become a standard method to enhance model performance on intricate tasks.\n\n4. **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**: An extension of CoT, this approach decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates several thoughts per step, forming a tree structure. The search process can be performed using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier or through a majority vote.\n\n5. **LLM+P (Large Language Model plus Planner)**: This method integrates LLMs with an external classical planner. It involves:\n   - Translating the problem into ‚ÄúProblem PDDL‚Äù (Planning Domain Definition Language).\n   - Using an external planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing ‚ÄúDomain PDDL‚Äù.\n   - Translating the PDDL plan back into natural language.\n  \nBy utilizing these methods, tasks can be effectively decomposed into more manageable parts, allowing for more efficient problem-solving and planning.",

### Tying it together[‚Äã](#tying-it-together-1)

For convenience, we tie together all of the necessary steps in a single code cell:

```typescript
import { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/tools/retriever";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { CheerioWebBaseLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/cheerio";
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm3 = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });

const loader3 = new CheerioWebBaseLoader(
  "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"
);

const docs3 = await loader3.load();

const textSplitter3 = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
const splits3 = await textSplitter3.splitDocuments(docs3);
const vectorStore3 = await MemoryVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  splits3,
  new OpenAIEmbeddings()
);

// Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
const retriever3 = vectorStore3.asRetriever();

const tool2 = createRetrieverTool(retriever3, {
  name: "blog_post_retriever",
  description:
    "Searches and returns excerpts from the Autonomous Agents blog post.",
});
const tools2 = [tool2];
const memory4 = new MemorySaver();

const agentExecutor3 = createReactAgent({
  llm: llm3,
  tools: tools2,
  checkpointSaver: memory4,
});

```

## Next steps[‚Äã](#next-steps) We‚Äôve covered the steps to build a basic conversational Q&A application:

- We used chains to build a predictable application that generates search queries for each user input;
- We used agents to build an application that ‚Äúdecides‚Äù when and how to generate search queries.

To explore different types of retrievers and retrieval strategies, visit the [retrievers](/docs/how_to#retrievers) section of the how-to guides.
