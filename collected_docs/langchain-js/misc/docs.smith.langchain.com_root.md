[Enroll for free](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/deep-research-with-langgraph/?utm_medium=internal&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=q3-2025_deep-research-course_co).[On this pageGet started with LangSmith LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence. ![ ](/assets/images/ls-diagram-5be7dd68b135f573a7b0e163692e6800.png)Observability](/observability)Analyze traces in LangSmith and configure metrics, dashboards, alerts based on these. ### [Evals](/evaluation) Evaluate your application over production traffic ‚Äî score application performance and get human feedback on your data. ### [Prompt Engineering](/prompt_engineering/quickstarts/quickstart_ui) Iterate on prompts, with automatic version control and collaboration features. LangSmith + LangChain OSSLangSmith is framework-agnostic ‚Äî¬†it can be used with or without LangChain&#x27;s open source frameworks [langchain](https://python.langchain.com) and [langgraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).If you are using either of these, you can enable LangSmith tracing with a single environment variable. For more see the how-to guide for [setting up LangSmith with LangChain](/observability/how_to_guides/trace_with_langchain) or [setting up LangSmith with LangGraph](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/tracing/trace_with_langgraph). ## Observability[‚Äã](#observability) Observability is important for any software application, but especially so for LLM applications. LLMs are non-deterministic by nature, meaning they can produce unexpected results. This makes them trickier than normal to debug. This is where LangSmith can help! LangSmith has LLM-native observability, allowing you to get meaningful insights from your application. LangSmith‚Äôs observability features have you covered throughout all stages of application development - from prototyping, to beta testing, to production. Get started by [adding tracing](/observability) to your application.

- [Create dashboards](/observability/how_to_guides/dashboards) to view key metrics like RPS, error rates and costs.

## Evals[‚Äã](#evals)

The quality and development speed of AI applications depends on high-quality evaluation datasets and metrics to test and optimize your applications on. The LangSmith SDK and UI make building and running high-quality evaluations easy.

- Get started by [creating your first evaluation](/evaluation).

- Quickly assess the performance of your application using our [off-the-shelf evaluators](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/prebuilt_evaluators) as a starting point.

- [Analyze results](/evaluation/how_to_guides#analyzing-experiment-results) of evaluations in the LangSmith UI and [compare results](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/compare_experiment_results) over time.

- Easily collect [human feedback](/evaluation/how_to_guides#annotation-queues-and-human-feedback) on your data to improve your application.

## Prompt Engineering[‚Äã](#prompt-engineering)

While traditional software applications are built by writing code, AI applications involve writing prompts to instruct the LLM on what to do. LangSmith provides a set of tools designed to enable and facilitate prompt engineering to help you find the perfect prompt for your application.

- Get started by [creating your first prompt](/prompt_engineering/how_to_guides/create_a_prompt).

- Iterate on models and prompts using the [Playground](/prompt_engineering/how_to_guides#playground).

- [Manage prompts programmatically](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/prompt_engineering/how_to_guides/prompts/manage_prompts_programatically) in your application.
