Agents are systems that take a high-level task and use an LLM as a reasoning engine to decide what actions to take and execute those actions. [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture/#langgraph) is an extension of LangChain specifically aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents. We recommend that you use LangGraph for building agents. Please see the following resources for more information: LangGraph docs on [common agent architectures](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/)

## Legacy agent concept: AgentExecutor[‚Äã](#legacy-agent-concept-agentexecutor)

LangChain previously introduced the `AgentExecutor` as a runtime for agents. While it served as an excellent starting point, its limitations became apparent when dealing with more sophisticated and customized agents. As a result, we&#x27;re gradually phasing out `AgentExecutor` in favor of more flexible solutions in LangGraph.

### Transitioning from AgentExecutor to LangGraph[‚Äã](#transitioning-from-agentexecutor-to-langgraph)

If you&#x27;re currently using `AgentExecutor`, don&#x27;t worry! We&#x27;ve prepared resources to help you:

- For those who still need to use AgentExecutor, we offer a comprehensive guide on [how to use AgentExecutor](/docs/how_to/agent_executor/).

- However, we strongly recommend transitioning to LangGraph for improved flexibility and control. To facilitate this transition, we&#x27;ve created a detailed [migration guide](/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/) to help you move from AgentExecutor to LangGraph seamlessly.
