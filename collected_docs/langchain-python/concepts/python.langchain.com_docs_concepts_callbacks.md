This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks. You can subscribe to these events by using the callbacks argument available throughout the API. This argument is a list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail.

Async callback handlers implement the [AsyncCallbackHandler](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/callbacks/langchain_core.callbacks.base.AsyncCallbackHandler.html) interface. During run-time LangChain configures an appropriate callback manager (e.g., [CallbackManager](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/callbacks/langchain_core.callbacks.manager.CallbackManager.html) or [AsyncCallbackManager](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/callbacks/langchain_core.callbacks.manager.AsyncCallbackManager.html) which will be responsible for calling the appropriate method on each "registered" callback handler when the event is triggered. Passing callbacks[‚Äã](#passing-callbacks) The callbacks property is available on most objects throughout the API (Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places: Request time callbacks**: Passed at the time of the request in addition to the input data. Available on all standard Runnable objects. These callbacks are INHERITED by all children of the object they are defined on. For example, chain.invoke({"number": 25}, {"callbacks": [handler]}).

- **Constructor callbacks**: chain = TheNameOfSomeChain(callbacks=[handler]). These callbacks are passed as arguments to the constructor of the object. The callbacks are scoped only to the object they are defined on, and are **not** inherited by any children of the object.

warningConstructor callbacks are scoped only to the object they are defined on. They are **not** inherited by children of the object.

If you&#x27;re creating a custom chain or runnable, you need to remember to propagate request time callbacks to any child objects.
