It involves testing the model&#x27;s responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications. ![ ](/assets/images/langsmith_evaluate-7d48643f3e4c50d77234e13feb95144d.png) [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) helps with this process in a few ways: It makes it easier to create and curate datasets via its tracing and annotation features

- It provides an evaluation framework that helps you define metrics and run your app against your dataset

- It allows you to track results over time and automatically run your evaluators on a schedule or as part of CI/Code
