This is known as [few-shot prompting](/docs/concepts/few_shot_prompting/). This gives the [language model](/docs/concepts/chat_models/) concrete examples of how it should behave. Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for more advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them. Example Selectors** are classes responsible for selecting and then formatting examples into prompts. ## Related resources[‚Äã](#related-resources) [Example selector how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#example-selectors)
