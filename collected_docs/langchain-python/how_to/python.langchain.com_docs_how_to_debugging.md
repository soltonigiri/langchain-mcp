There are three main methods for debugging: Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for "important" events in your chain. Debug Mode: This add logging statements for ALL events in your chain. LangSmith Tracing: This logs events to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to allow for visualization there. Verbose ModeDebug ModeLangSmith TracingFree✅✅✅UI❌❌✅Persisted❌❌✅See all events❌✅✅See "important" events✅❌✅Runs Locally✅✅❌ Tracing[​](#tracing) Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com). After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."

``` Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

``` Let&#x27;s suppose we have an agent, and want to visualize the actions it takes and tool outputs it receives. Without any debugging, here&#x27;s what we see: Select [chat model](/docs/integrations/chat/):Google Gemini▾[OpenAI](#)[Anthropic](#)[Azure](#)[Google Gemini](#)[Google Vertex](#)[AWS](#)[Groq](#)[Cohere](#)[NVIDIA](#)[Fireworks AI](#)[Mistral AI](#)[Together AI](#)[IBM watsonx](#)[Databricks](#)[xAI](#)[Perplexity](#)[DeepSeek](#)

 &#x27;output&#x27;: "The 2023 film **Oppenheimer** was directed by **Christopher Nolan**.\n\nChristopher Nolan was born on **July 30, 1970**. To calculate his age in days as of today:\n\n1.

Use the formula: \\[ \\text{Age in days} = (\\text{Current Year} - \\text{Birth Year}) \\times 365 + \\text{Extra Days for Leap Years} + \\text{Days from Birthday to Today&#x27;s Date} \\]\n\nLet&#x27;s calculate:\n\n- From July 30, 1970, to July 30, 2023, is 53 years.\n- From July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023, is 130 days.\n\nLeap years between 1970 and 2023 (every 4 years, except century years not divisible by 400):\n1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020.

``` We don&#x27;t get much output, but since we set up LangSmith we can easily see what happened under the hood: [https://smith.langchain.com/public/a89ff88f-9ddc-4757-a395-3a1b365655bf/r](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a89ff88f-9ddc-4757-a395-3a1b365655bf/r) ## set_debug and set_verbose[​](#set_debug-and-set_verbose) If you&#x27;re prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Python scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run. There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity. Note: These still work even with LangSmith enabled, so you can have both turned on and running at the same time ### set_verbose(True)[​](#set_verbosetrue) Setting the verbose flag will print out inputs and outputs in a slightly more readable format and will skip logging certain raw outputs (like the token usage stats for an LLM call) so that you can focus on application logic.

```python
from langchain.globals import set_verbose

set_verbose(True)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
agent_executor.invoke(
    {"input": "Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age in days?"}
)

Nolan’s breakthrough came with the 2000 film Memento, a sleeper hit that he adapted from a short story written by his brother Jonathan Nolan. The film was a critical and popular success and garnered the Nolan brothers an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. Nolan’s highly anticipated Batman Begins (2005), starring Christian Bale, focuses on the superhero’s origins and features settings and a tone that are grimmer and more realistic than those of previous Batman films.
