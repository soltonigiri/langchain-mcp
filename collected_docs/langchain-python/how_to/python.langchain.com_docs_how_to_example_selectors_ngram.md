The ngram overlap score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. The [selector](/docs/concepts/example_selectors/) allows for a threshold score to be set. Examples with an ngram overlap score less than or equal to the threshold are excluded. The threshold is set to -1.0, by default, so will not exclude any examples, only reorder them. Setting the threshold to 0.0 will exclude examples that have no ngram overlaps with the input.

```python
from langchain_community.example_selectors import NGramOverlapExampleSelector
from langchain_core.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate

example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input", "output"],
    template="Input: {input}\nOutput: {output}",
)

# Examples of a fictional translation task.
examples = [
    {"input": "See Spot run.", "output": "Ver correr a Spot."},
    {"input": "My dog barks.", "output": "Mi perro ladra."},
    {"input": "Spot can run.", "output": "Spot puede correr."},
]

```API Reference:**[FewShotPromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.few_shot.FewShotPromptTemplate.html) | [PromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html)

```python
example_selector = NGramOverlapExampleSelector(
    # The examples it has available to choose from.
    examples=examples,
    # The PromptTemplate being used to format the examples.
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    # The threshold, at which selector stops.
    # It is set to -1.0 by default.
    threshold=-1.0,
    # For negative threshold:
    # Selector sorts examples by ngram overlap score, and excludes none.
    # For threshold greater than 1.0:
    # Selector excludes all examples, and returns an empty list.
    # For threshold equal to 0.0:
    # Selector sorts examples by ngram overlap score,
    # and excludes those with no ngram overlap with input.
)
dynamic_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    # We provide an ExampleSelector instead of examples.
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix="Give the Spanish translation of every input",
    suffix="Input: {sentence}\nOutput:",
    input_variables=["sentence"],
)

```

```python
# An example input with large ngram overlap with "Spot can run."
# and no overlap with "My dog barks."
print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence="Spot can run fast."))

```

```output
Give the Spanish translation of every input

Input: Spot can run.
Output: Spot puede correr.

Input: See Spot run.
Output: Ver correr a Spot.

Input: My dog barks.
Output: Mi perro ladra.

Input: Spot can run fast.
Output:

```

```python
# You can add examples to NGramOverlapExampleSelector as well.
new_example = {"input": "Spot plays fetch.", "output": "Spot juega a buscar."}

example_selector.add_example(new_example)
print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence="Spot can run fast."))

```

```output
Give the Spanish translation of every input

Input: Spot can run.
Output: Spot puede correr.

Input: See Spot run.
Output: Ver correr a Spot.

Input: Spot plays fetch.
Output: Spot juega a buscar.

Input: My dog barks.
Output: Mi perro ladra.

Input: Spot can run fast.
Output:

```

```python
# You can set a threshold at which examples are excluded.
# For example, setting threshold equal to 0.0
# excludes examples with no ngram overlaps with input.
# Since "My dog barks." has no ngram overlaps with "Spot can run fast."
# it is excluded.
example_selector.threshold = 0.0
print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence="Spot can run fast."))

```

```output
Give the Spanish translation of every input

Input: Spot can run.
Output: Spot puede correr.

Input: See Spot run.
Output: Ver correr a Spot.

Input: Spot plays fetch.
Output: Spot juega a buscar.

Input: Spot can run fast.
Output:

```

```python
# Setting small nonzero threshold
example_selector.threshold = 0.09
print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence="Spot can play fetch."))

```

```output
Give the Spanish translation of every input

Input: Spot can run.
Output: Spot puede correr.

Input: Spot plays fetch.
Output: Spot juega a buscar.

Input: Spot can play fetch.
Output:

```

```python
# Setting threshold greater than 1.0
example_selector.threshold = 1.0 + 1e-9
print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence="Spot can play fetch."))

```

```output
Give the Spanish translation of every input

Input: Spot can play fetch.
Output:
