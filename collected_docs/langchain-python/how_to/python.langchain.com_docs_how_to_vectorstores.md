One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are &#x27;most similar&#x27; to the embedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you. ## Get started[‚Äã](#get-started) This guide showcases basic functionality related to vector stores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [text embedding model interfaces](/docs/how_to/embed_text/) before diving into this. Before using the vectorstore at all, we need to load some data and initialize an embedding model. We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ[&#x27;OPENAI_API_KEY&#x27;] = getpass.getpass(&#x27;OpenAI API Key:&#x27;)

```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

# Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.
raw_documents = TextLoader(&#x27;state_of_the_union.txt&#x27;).load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)

``` There are many great vector store options, here are a few that are free, open-source, and run entirely on your local machine. Review all integrations for many great hosted offerings. Chroma
- FAISS
- Lance

This walkthrough uses the `chroma` vector database, which runs on your local machine as a library.

```bash
pip install langchain-chroma

```

```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())

```This walkthrough uses the `FAISS` vector database, which makes use of the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library.

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu

```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())

```This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the LanceDB vector database based on the Lance data format.

```bash
pip install lancedb

```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import LanceDB

import lancedb

db = lancedb.connect("/tmp/lancedb")
table = db.create_table(
    "my_table",
    data=[
        {
            "vector": embeddings.embed_query("Hello World"),
            "text": "Hello World",
            "id": "1",
        }
    ],
    mode="overwrite",
)
db = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())

``` ## Similarity search[‚Äã](#similarity-search) All vectorstores expose a `similarity_search` method. This will take incoming documents, create an embedding of them, and then find all documents with the most similar embedding.

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)

```

```output
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you‚Äôre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I‚Äôd like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer‚Äîan Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.

``` ### Similarity search by vector[‚Äã](#similarity-search-by-vector) It is also possible to do a search for documents similar to a given embedding vector using `similarity_search_by_vector` which accepts an embedding vector as a parameter instead of a string.

```python
embedding_vector = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query(query)
docs = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)
print(docs[0].page_content)

```

```output
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you‚Äôre at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I‚Äôd like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer‚Äîan Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation‚Äôs top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer‚Äôs legacy of excellence.

``` ## Async Operations[‚Äã](#async-operations) Vector stores are usually run as a separate service that requires some IO operations, and therefore they might be called asynchronously. That gives performance benefits as you don&#x27;t waste time waiting for responses from external services. That might also be important if you work with an asynchronous framework, such as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

LangChain supports async operation on vector stores. All the methods might be called using their async counterparts, with the prefix `a`, meaning `async`.

```python
docs = await db.asimilarity_search(query)
docs

```

```output
