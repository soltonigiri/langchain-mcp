- üêû **Debug mistakes**: Identify where and why errors occurred.

- üîç **Explore alternatives**: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.

LangGraph provides [time travel functionality](../../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel/) to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint ‚Äî either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history.

Tip

For information on how to use time travel, see [Use time travel](../../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel/) and [Time travel using Server API](../../cloud/how-tos/human_in_the_loop_time_travel/).
